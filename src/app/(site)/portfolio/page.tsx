              Life should be lived at full volume. That means getting your
              friends together, turning up the music to full volume and dancing
              all night to a clear, rich sound. With our new ISi range of
              speakers, you can make the most of every single moment, power
              parties you’ll remember forever, and always live your life out
              loud.

            We helped ISi build an App that helps Isi speakers to be different
            from others. More than 2 persons can connect through the app and can
            play songs after on and other. We also made an e-commerce website
            from where you can directly buy it and enjoy music
