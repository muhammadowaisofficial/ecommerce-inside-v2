              Life should be lived at full volume. That means getting your
              friends together, turning up the music to full volume and dancing
              all night to a clear, rich sound. With our new ISi range of
              speakers, you can make the most of every single moment, power
              parties youâ€™ll remember forever, and always live your life out
              loud.

            We helped ISi build an App that helps Isi speakers to be different
            from others. More than 2 persons can connect through the app and can
            play songs after on and other. We also made an e-commerce website
            from where you can directly buy it and enjoy music
